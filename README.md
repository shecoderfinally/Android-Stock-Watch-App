# Stock Search Android Application ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š  

The Stock Search Android Application provides users with a mobile platform to search for stock symbols, view detailed information about specific stocks, manage their watchlist, and monitor their portfolio. Users can access various features within the app to perform different actions related to stock management.  

This project is an Android application built using Java/Kotlin, Retrofit, and Room Database. It allows users to search for stocks and select from a list of matching stock symbols using autocomplete functionality via the Finnhub API. The app displays search results, lets users add stocks to their watchlist, and provides a portfolio tracker. The app uses Retrofit for making HTTP requests to the backend server and Room Database for storing user data, such as watchlists and portfolios, locally. The backend fetches stock data from the Finnhub API and updates the user interface accordingly.
